The State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD) are a set of longitudinal State-specific emergency department (ED) databases included in the HCUP family. The SEDD capture discharge information on all emergency department visits that do not result in an admission. Information on patients seen in the emergency room and then admitted to the hospital is included in the State Inpatient Databases (SID).

The HCUP website has great data base documentation for SEDD, from a high-level Overview to all the detailed specifications, restrictions, and resources necessary for researchers working and publishing with the SEDD.
