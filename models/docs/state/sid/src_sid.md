{% docs sedd_description %}

The State Inpatient Databases (SID) are State-specific files that contain all inpatient care records in participating states. Together, the SID encompass more than 95 percent of all U.S. hospital discharges. The uniform format of the SID helps facilitate cross-state comparisons. In addition, the SID are well suited for research that requires complete enumeration of hospitals and discharges within geographic areas or states.

The following links provide database documentation for the SID, from a high-level Overview to all the detailed specifications, restrictions, and resources necessary for researchers working and publishing with the SID.
