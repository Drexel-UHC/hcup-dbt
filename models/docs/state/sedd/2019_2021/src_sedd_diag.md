Diagnosis and Procedure Groups file is an encounter-level file that contains data elements from AHRQ software tools. They are designed to facilitate the use of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM/PCS) diagnostic and procedure information in the HCUP databases. The unit of observation is an emergency department visit. The HCUP unique record identifier (KEY) provides the linkage between the Core files and the Diagnosis and Procedure Groups files. These files are available beginning with the 2005 SEDD.
